* _**Login**_ takes a user's handle (a short username) and password and checks that they exist in the database.

* _**search**_ shows a list of all the one- and two-hop itineraries for flying from the given origin to the given destination on the given day of the month. (The search is always limited to the month of July 2015, so the user only needs to specify which day in that month.)
